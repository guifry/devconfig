First video. It was released before the second video. I can't tell if it's describing the correct ralph software or the "bad plugin" that the second video talks about. Nevertheless, I think there are interesting techniques being discussed in it.

We got Ryan Carson on the pod to break down the “Ralph Wiggum” Agent and why it’s suddenly everywhere. He walks me through a simple workflow that lets an autonomous agent build a full product feature while I sleep: start with a PRD, convert it into small user stories with tight acceptance criteria, then run a looped script that ships work in clean iterations. The big idea is you’re not “vibe coding” one giant prompt—you’re giving the agent testable, bite-sized tickets and letting it execute like an engineering team. By the end, Ryan shows how this becomes repeatable (and safer) with a memory layer—agents.md for long-term notes and progress.txt for iteration-to-iteration context.

Key Points

I can’t expect “sleep-shipping” unless I translate the feature into small, testable user stories with clear acceptance criteria.
Ralph works like a Kanban loop: pull one story, implement, commit, mark pass/fail, then grab the next.
The real leverage is the reset: each iteration starts fresh with a clean context window, instead of one giant, messy thread.
agents.md becomes long-term memory across the repo; progress.txt is short-term memory across iterations.
The bottleneck isn’t “coding”—it’s the upfront spec quality: PRD clarity, atomic stories, and verifiable criteria.

------------------------------------------------
Today we're breaking down the clearest
explanation of Ralph Wiggins. No, not
The Simpsons character. It's the AI
coding loop that everyone is freaking
out about. Ralph is a simple idea with
huge consequences. [music]
You give an agent a list of small tasks
and it keeps picking one, implementing
it, testing it, committing the code.
It's basically a way for you to have AI
agents building your business, building
your product overnight while you sleep.
Sounds too good to be true, but it
works. [music] And it uses Claude Opus
4.5 to go and do it. So, in this
episode, this is the clearest
explanation [music]
of how beginners can learn how to use WA
Ralph. You don't need to be technical to
understand it. By the end of this
episode, you will be capable to
implement [music] Ralph so that you too
could wake up to features fully done for
ideas in your head for the startup you
want to build. Enjoy the episode.
[music]
>> We finally got Ryan Carson on the pod.
This is a guy who ran I don't know if
you know this but I was a treehouse
customer. I learned how to code many
years ago maybe
>> 12 years ago and he is one of the best
communicators when it when when it comes
to learning AI learning how to code. So
we brought him on to figure out what the
hell is Ralph [laughter] waiting?
>> What is happening? Greg, it's so good to
be here, man. Like I literally watch
your show. I'm not one of those people
that's like I watch show and don't I do
um it's packed packed with knowledge so
it's fun to get the invite. Um and it's
crazy you were a treehouse student. I I
mean I learned how to code getting a
computer science degree which seems
hilarious now. And I decided people
shouldn't need a computer science
degree. So launched Treehouse taught a
million people how to code and now
people really don't need a computer
science degree. [laughter]
>> That's right. So,
>> so for for this for this episode, what
are people going to learn? And if they
stick around to the end, you know, who
are they going to be?
>> So, what I'm going to teach everybody is
how to build an entire feature for your
app while you sleep. So, if you watch
through the end, you're going to have
all of the technical knowledge, even if
you're not a hardcore developer. Um, in
fact, I would say this is perfect for
you if you're not a hardcore developer.
Um, you're going to have all the
knowledge, all the code. I literally
have a repo that you can go and download
the code. Uh, so watch to the end and
you're going to have uh you're going to
have the sauce.
>> All right, let's do it.
>> Okay, so um a friend of mine named Jeff
Huntley thought up this idea called
Ralph. Um, and Jeff is super creative.
Um, and he launched this a while ago and
the idea is really simple. Um, but it
that's why it's so good. Um, so
yesterday I thought, you know, I'm just
going to post about this and give people
a breakdown of what is this thing, how
does it work, and you know, you never
quite know when the algo is going to hit
Unx. Um, sometimes it does, sometimes it
doesn't. And this went bonkers, right?
So you can see we're over 700,000 views.
And then there's been retweets of this
thing that have got over 100,000 views
each. So it's just um gone ballistic. So
what is it? Well, I'm going to walk you
through it. We we'll I'm sure Greg will
uh share all the links um in the show
notes so you can click through and read
this, but I'm actually going to walk you
through a workflow of what is Ralph and
how does it work. So let's start there.
Um
all right, so
say that you're building an app, right?
You know that you want to add a feature
to it. Um this is often uh when you do
what's called a product requirement doc
or a PRD. Um, the idea is that you want
to build something like, uh, hey, I want
to add this new feature that does XYZ.
Um, and you want to build that, but it's
pretty complex. Like, this is not a
oneshot, you know, make me a landing
page. Like, this is a pretty complex
thing you want to add to your app. Well,
how do you do that? So, you start off
with writing a PRD. And a PRD,
thankfully, is something that agents are
really good at. Um, so the way that you
do that, uh, is that you actually have
AMP or Cloud Code or or whoever is your,
uh, agent of choice do that. So, I'm
going to show you how I do that. Um, I'm
going to
show you this, which is called the PRD
generator. Um, so what I do is I fire up
AMP and I basically start talking. I use
Whisper Flow, love it. And I basically
say, "Okay, I want to build this feature
and this is all the stuff it should do."
And and and I just talk for often like
two, three minutes. And then I tag this
file, right? So this is a simple
markdown file. This is a skill um called
PRD generator. And this isn't rocket
science, right? So it's got the job that
you want uh AMP to do or your agent to
do. Um it's going to receive a feature
description from the user. It's going to
ask three to five essential questions
that clarify. It's going to ask for uh
answers to basic questions. Right? So,
this is a pretty standard prompt. Right?
So, what I've done just to remind you is
if we go back to our flow, I've opened
up AMP. I've clicked Whisper Flow and
I've started talking. And then I tag
this file or this skill and I say use my
uh PRD skill and turn this into a PRD.
Um, and you can actually see I've got a
real life example of me doing this. Um,
uh, and a file that ends up being a PRD.
So, let's go back here. All right. So,
you've got this markdown file, which is
a product requirement doc. And again,
just in kind of normal person language,
that's just a description of what you
want to build. Um, and it often has
things called user stories in there,
which are specific things that you want
the user to be able to do uh in this
feature. So now you've got a markdown
file. Great. What do you do with that?
Um, so the next step is this is a a
Ralph specific thing is that you create
you convert this into a JSON file. Now
I've shown sort of an example of a JSON
file. If you don't know what that is,
it's basically a specific format that
computers like. So, and what you can see
is that this is a user story. Um, so the
title is add priority field to a
database. Uh, and then the acceptance
criteria. This is the most important
thing. So,
how do you how does AMP or your agent
know if it's done with this thing? You
have to give it clear uh what we call
acceptance criteria. They're basically
tests so that the agent by itself can
build this thing and know if it was done
without asking you. Um, so the whole key
of Ralph is that it's going to build
this whole feature while you sleep. But
how is it going to do that without you
saying all the time that's good or
that's bad or this needs to be fixed? It
has to know if it passed the acceptance
criteria. Right? So this is one of the
big unlocks um with Ralph or any kind of
flow like this is that the agent needs
to have a feedback mechanism so that it
knows if what it's doing is correct. So
what you're saying is the alternative is
you have to be Ralph, right? You have to
be that person to be like, "Yes, no,
maybe."
>> Yeah. You have to do all the testing,
right? Um and that's a pain. So, and the
agents are smart enough now, Opus 45 is
smart enough now that if you give it
good acceptance criteria, it can do it.
So, all right. So, we've got a PRD, a
product requirement doc. uh we've used
this uh this skill um let me take this
here
okay so now this is called the Ralph PRD
converter and it says it converts a PRD
to a PRD.json JSON file um for the Ralph
autonomous agent system and it basically
says okay take a PRD in markdown format
and then output it like this right so
this is telling the agent exactly what
you need uh the PRD to be turned into
and it has a couple really important
things here like the story size the
number one rule each story must be
completable in one Ralph iteration so
this is the other big unlock with
working with agents
is that they have a context limit,
right? So, uh you know, with Opus,
you're looking at about 168,000 tokens.
You have to be picking chunks of work
that can be fully completed within that
context window. And this is the this is
why Ralph works so well is that it runs
little uh um independent threads where
it completes one user story because it's
not very big. So you've got a bunch of
very small user stories. Um story
ordering it puts uh the ones that it
should do first at the top. Um and then
it says acceptance criteria. They must
be verifiable. Right? So this is really
key. So good criterias are add you know
status columns to the to task table with
default pending. Uh you can filter
drop-down uh has options all active
completed. And again, these are things
that AMP wrote for me and I verified.
Um, but they're important that it's in
there. So, let's go back. All right. So,
we've created our product requirement
doc. Great. We've uh used the Ralph
skill to turn it into a JSON file.
Great. Now,
we run a script. So, this is a little
different. So, most of us are who have
used agents like an AMP or a cloud code
or a cursor. you're used to opening up
uh that program, right? So you open up
cursor or you open up AMP and you start
talking to it, right? This is actually a
bash script, right? So this is a file
that the that your actual local computer
runs. Um so I'm going to show you
actually what this looks like really
quick.
>> [clears throat]
>> And for people who don't know what bash
is, it's it's just a way for
>> it's just a type of so so so when you
open up your command uh like your
terminal which is basically uh a text
input box for your computer, you can
type commands on it and you can also run
scripts on it. So that's what a bash
script is. It's a type of file that the
computer can run from the command line.
So, um, I'll show you what this looks
like. And again, this is all open source
and we're going to have all these notes,
uh, all these links in the notes. And
so, you could literally take this Ralph,
um, public repo I have, download it, and
use it. So, let's go and look what this
actually looks like. Now, this looks
kind of scary, [clears throat]
but let's look at what it's actually
doing. So, it's saying, okay, how many
times can this script run? Um, the
default is 10. Um, it has a script
directory. It has the PRD file, right?
Like we talked about this. So it's it's
called prd.json.
Um it's got a progress file, which we're
going to talk about. Um and then the
idea is that it archives the script when
it's done. And then basically it does a
loop. And I'll explain how that loops
works visually because it looks nicer
than than bash. But this is the actual
file that runs. So
once again, we'll we'll quickly recap.
We've got a prd we wrote. We converted
it into a prd.json which is just a list
of user stories. Every user story is
very small, right? It has very clear
acceptance criteria. Um and then you go
to the command line and you run the the
Ralph script. Uh which is you type a
couple characters and you hit enter. Um
now then what happens and why is this so
exciting? So all right. So then what
happens is the agent, you know, I use
AMP. It picks one of the stories.
Usually it picks the first one um and
it's looking for any user story that has
uh passes false, right? So you can see
here has has this user story uh been uh
does it pass or not? No, this one
doesn't. So let's grab it. Right? And
this is the other really cool thing
about Ralph. So for decades, right,
teams of engineers have been working
this way. You have a list of usually
sticky notes or now uh now it's combon
boards, right? And you have a user
story, you pull it off and you say, "I'm
going to do that." You go to your desk,
you start coding, right? And then you
complete it, you commit it, and you
merge it, right? And then you come back
to the board and you grab another sticky
note, right? This is the way humans have
been coding forever. And the reason why
is because it works, right? You have a
unit of work that you can understand,
that you can test, and you can complete
independently,
right? And this is exactly what Ralph is
doing. So, it's picking a story,
grabbing off the board, and it's
tackling it. So, then, you know, it
starts running, it starts working,
right? And this is what we're all used
to if you're in cloud code or if you're
in AMP or if you're in cursor, you know,
you [snorts] say, "Okay, build this
thing." And you start seeing it working,
right? Um, so I'm actually going to show
you, uh, I today, um, I posted and I
said, "Okay, this is a real thing." Um,
I actually built an entire feature with
Ralph and these are the steps I took. I
created the PRD. I created the, uh, the
user stories, and then I started Ralph.
And then I'm just going to show you an
example of kind of what this looks like
for real. So this is a thread, an AMP.
This is basically what you would usually
look at and type into. And these are
this is the system prompt that Ralph
gets. Right. So it says you're an
autonomous coding agent working on my
project um your task read the PRD read
the progress log um and just do a bunch
of stuff and then it basically says and
then it starts working on it.
Pretty straightforward. And then you can
see down here it's actually cranking
right. So this is the kind of stuff
you're used to seeing. So there here it
starts writing code. Now, the whole time
that this is happening, I'm sleeping,
right? [laughter]
Or, you know, I'm having dinner with my
amazing wife or something or I'm paying
attention to my kids, right? Um, but
Ralph AMP is cranking on that first user
story um without me having to look at
it, give it feedback, do anything
because it has everything it needs, the
context, it has uh the acceptance
criteria, it has everything.
>> What about tokens? Is it burning through
my tokens?
>> No, this is the beautiful thing. So, I
actually looked at uh a couple of these.
Um let's actually look really quick.
Yeah. So, look at this. This was three
bucks. I mean, $3, that's less than a
latte.
>> Totally.
>> So, the the question is how valuable is
your time, right? I I think that, you
know, for some people $3 is going to be
too much, right? So, so for instance,
the typical Ralph um cycle is probably
10 iterations. So, you're looking at
maybe 30 bucks. Um but think about how
expensive and how hard that would have
been with your time or developers time.
Um so it becomes, you know, pretty
amazing. I like and I'll do one plug
which is that we're about to launch a
daily uh free token um allowance on AMP
and so you get like 10 bucks a day. So
you could do this for free. So um the
and so I think people are afraid of like
what if the agent runs by itself? Is it
going to go off and do crazy things? And
the answer is no because you gave it a
clear user story with clear acceptance
criteria, right? It's going to be
actually a pretty small thread. So
>> right, I mean it only does a crazy thing
if your criteria is crazy,
>> right?
>> Yeah.
>> So this is the whole point is you have
these these very small atomic user
stories. Oh, all right. So, AMP cranks,
it actually finishes the feature, uh,
the user story. Um, and then it commits
the change, right? So, it's like, okay,
I did everything. And this is really
important. This is in the system
instructions for Ralph when you finish
commit because you may need to roll
back, right? You may need to go back and
fix things. And this allows the agent to
do that if it needs it. Um, this is
pretty standard stuff for for agents.
And then what it does next is it updates
the the prd.json. Um, and if you look at
this, it's going to change this uh from
passes false to passes true. So all of a
sudden, it's like that person, they go
back to the board and they put the
sticky note back on and it's crossed
off, right? Um, and then this is one of
the most important things is that it it
logs its progress. So this here is
really important. So what's going to
happen is when this iteration is
finished, it's going to learn things.
It's going to learn things about your
codebase. it's going to run into, you
know, walls and have to go around them.
You don't want it learning that stuff
every time, right? So, what it does is a
very simple prompt. It says, if you
learned, if any of the files you edited
have agents.md files in that folder and
you learn something that's important,
update that file.
So, not only are you, and this is what
uh Kieran and the team over at every
absolutely crushed with their compound
engineering concept is that your agent
should be getting smarter every time it
makes a mistake. Um, and by updating
agents.mmd, you're going to get that
long-term benefit. This isn't just
during this iteration. You're going to
benefit every time from now on that you
use AMP or cloud code. So,
>> and for people who don't know what
agents.mmd is and the importance of it,
can you give a a quick primer on it?
>> You bet. So, what it's a very simple
file. It's literally a markdown file.
And think of it as um notes that you
would give to a new developer who had
never seen your code. And the neat thing
is you can have an agents.md file in
every every folder in your entire repo
if you want. And what happens is AMP
will if it AMP starts looking at a a
file in a folder and it sees an
agent.mmd file in that folder, it will
read it first. So it's cool. It's like
sticky notes everywhere, right? So it's
like if you, you know, have some
knowledge about this part of the
codebase and you really want the dev to
know, hey, before you mess with stuff,
read this. Um, that's what agents.mmd
does. So you can have it at the top of
your folders directory so that gets read
every time the agent works or you can
put it bury it down in some subfolder so
that it it just reads that uh when it's
editing that file. Um so that so that's
really really important. If you don't do
this you're going to have a bad time
over and over again. Um and then it what
it does is it updates a progress.txt
file. Um this is like short-term memory.
So, this is like saying, hey, during
during these 10 iterations that Ralph is
going to do, what are some things that
we're kind of learning? What are we
doing? Um, how does all this work? I'm
actually going to show you um actually I
won't show you example because it's a
bunch of text, but the idea is for each
iteration, it's going to say, okay, here
was the AMP thread that we used, which
is great because then the agent can go
back and read it. So, say that you get
to iteration two and it wants to see,
well, what I do in iteration one, it can
actually read that thread and figure it
out. Um, it also puts a couple notes in
there like, oh yeah, I probably, you
know, shouldn't do that in the future or
I should think about this. It's more of
a short-term memory, whereas agents.mmd
is its long-term memory things that it
really needs to remember. So, that is uh
uh login and progress.txt.
Any anything confusing so far?
>> Crystal clear. Nice.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. So, what happens next? Um, well,
then Ralph says, "Okay, is there any
more stories?" So, it goes back up to
the little board and looks for more
sticky notes, right? And it says, "Oh,
yep. There is more stories." So, I just
do it again, right? I pick a story. It
usually picks the next one in the JSON
file. Um, but the nice thing about it is
it's like a human. It can also figure
out, well, I could do that story or that
story. I'll I'll pick this one because
that would be smarter. So it grabs it,
then it implements it, it commits the
change, it updates the prd.json file, it
logs its progress updating any agents,
and it just does this over and over
again until
it's done. Um, so this I'm going to show
you again. This was a real example of me
using Ralph today. So this morning um I
built a big feature into my app. Um so I
created the PRD um and then I created
the the user stories and then we cranked
and we started doing this. Now this uh
Ralph iteration took 14 iterations to
do. And just to kind of zoom into like
one of these, right? What does this
actually look like?
So again, same system prompt. And now
this is the the key is I think people
don't get it like well why is this
different than me just like using AMP or
cloud code like on my computer. And
what's happening is you're getting a
fresh
loop every time. So you're getting a
brand new thread or a brand new instance
of clog code every time. So you're
starting fresh with a brand new context
window. Um starting from fresh. So these
are the instructions. This is what we're
doing. Read the PRD. do the stuff. Um,
uh, progress report format append
to it. Here's how to append. So, so the
things it's putting the progress file
are the AMP thread so that it can read
it again. what was implemented, the
files that were changed, any learnings
for future iterations, you know,
patterns discovered, gotas, useful
context, [clears throat] and then it
kind of cranks through and then it
starts down here,
you know, and that's pretty much it. I
mean, it's very, very simple. Um,
and with that, you can ship massive
features while you sleep. And y'all,
I've been, you know, I got my computer
science degree 26 years ago, right? I've
taught a million people how to code,
right? I've started companies with huge
engineering teams, right? This loop is
basically an entire engineering team
while you sleep. It's unbelievable. And
this just wasn't possible before Opus
45. I think with Opus 45, this is
absolutely the real deal. Um, and just
wait till OP 5 comes out. I mean, it's
so so exciting to be alive right now.
Yeah. And I think uh it's not just an
engineering team. It's a high quality
engineering team that you know runs by
best practices,
>> right? For $30.
>> For $30. [laughter]
>> It's so it's so crazy. Now, now in a
perfect the the real world is so let's
look back at this thread.
[clears throat]
>> Yeah.
>> At the bottom I said, you know, after I
finished I tested Manly and did find a
few edge bugs. This is normal, right?
you're going to probably run into a
couple things that don't quite work
right or aren't perfect, but you know,
AMP and I just worked on it and cranked
out fixes like really fast. Um, and the
feature shipped uh this morning. Um, so
that's what all the hub is about with
Ralph. Again, it's exciting because it's
so simple. It's a loop, right? It's
grabbing a user story and doing it. It's
having clear acceptance criteria and
then it's writing down what it learns so
that it doesn't make the same mistakes.
The last thing I will say very very very
important I'm going to zoom in
is this this these two steps writing a
PRD and converting them to user stories.
This is where you should spend a huge
amount of time. Like you should spend an
hour on this, right? It's very very very
important that you get your PRD right
and that your user stories are small
atomic and that you have clear
acceptance criteria. Um because if you
don't take your time on that, you're
going to get 10 iterations of Ralph and
you're going to end up with something
that's not very good. Um, and I will say
one tip, one like really good at the
coldface with your pick as you're
working is figure out how to connect
your agent to a browser. Right? So, I
have a specific skill um which is in um
let me actually show you GitHub. Let's
go to
snark tank
and I'm going to show you this repo
called AMP skills.
Um if the you can download all these
these are open source. Um now not open
source but this one is what I would use
which is your web is your dev browser.
Okay, so dev browser use this because
what this does is this allows AMP or
cloud code to actually use your uh
browser and test and your user stories
that involve front-end code. Um remember
that the agent needs to be able to test
that and testing browser is hard for
agents. So you have to give a specific
skill like dev browser. This is a free
skill that a friend of mine made. It's
really good. So, one small tip for you.
>> Cool. We'll include that in the show
notes. Um, if people want to get started
today, how do they get started with
Ralph?
>> So, I would probably go to this repo.
Um, so just go to github.comankral.
Um, it's completely free. Look at the
code, but just tell your agent to look
at this code. [laughter]
So, tell your agent to go set it up. If
you're using AMP, great, you know, and
it will crank it out, get it all set up,
and then say, "Okay, I want to, you
know, ship my first feature. Um, how do
I do it?" And it will walk you through
it.
>> And you believe that even if you're
non-technical,
you can do it.
>> Yeah, I think you need to be curious.
Um, I think you need to have agency. Um,
but I think if you have those two
things, which you probably do if you're
watching the show, um, uh, you can do
this. Now, it helps to be technical,
right? There's a couple things that are
are useful,
>> but I think we're now in a world where
if you want those skills, you can
acquire them very very quickly.
>> Um, and I'd encourage you
>> go out there and get your hands dirty.
Like, that's the most important thing is
use the thing. Um, figure out how it
works and then if you don't get it, ask
AMP, ask Cloud Code. Like, you have this
superhuman tutor to help you. So, just
ask them.
>> Ryan, thank you so much for coming on.
You you explained this exactly how I
wanted you to. Crystal clear.
Unbelievable. I would love to have Ryan
back on the pod if he if he would come
back. But you know, would you a would
you come back on the pod?
>> Let's do it. I'd love to. Let's share as
much knowledge as we can.
>> And I want that comment section on
YouTube buzzing for Ryan because uh
listen, it might it might look easy now.
You might be like, "Oh, I get Ralph.
That was super easy." But it's because
he explained it in a simple way which
which I think is uh the beauty about you
Ryan. So thank you so much. I'll include
links for all of this to get started.
Links to follow Ryan on X you know links
to AMP links to cloud code and Ryan.
Anything else you want to make mention
to?
>> Well thanks Greg for your content like
it is a big unlock. I think if people
want to learn these things they can. Um
and your content is a big piece of that.
And the second thing is I I would say is
you do not need a computer science
degree, y'all. You can do these things.
Like if you are curious and hardworking,
you can now do anything. And uh now is
your moment. So if you've got an idea,
build, build, build.
>> Yeah. Quit watching us right now.
>> Get out of here. Go. Get out of here.
>> All right. We'll see you next time.
Thanks again, Ryan.
