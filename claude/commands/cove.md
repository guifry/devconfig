description: Chain of Verification - self-fact-checking to reduce hallucinations
argument-hint: <question or task>

Apply Chain of Verification (CoVe). Follow these steps strictly:

## Step 1: Initial Response
Provide your initial answer to the question/task.

## Step 2: Verification Questions
Generate 3-5 questions that would expose errors, gaps, or hallucinations in your initial answer. Target the most uncertain claims.

## Step 3: Independent Verification
Answer each verification question independently. Do NOT defend your initial answer - verify objectively as if seeing the question fresh.

## Step 4: Final Verified Response
Based on verification results, provide your corrected final answer. Note what changed and why.
